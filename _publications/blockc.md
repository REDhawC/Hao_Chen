*Built a dataset on 38 listed companies across 7 industries that integrated blockchain technology into operations and their stock price performance from 2017 to 2022;

Performed multiple linear regression analysis with backward elimination in STATA and used PSM(Propensity Score Matching) to do robustness checks;

Results showed that the use of blockchain tech decreased the risks of stock price crashes.
